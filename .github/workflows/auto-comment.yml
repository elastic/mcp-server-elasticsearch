            This MCP server is deprecated and will only receive critical security updates going forward. It has been superseded by [Elastic Agent Builder](https://ela.st/agent-builder-docs)'s [MCP endpoint](https://ela.st/agent-builder-mcp), which is available in Elastic 9.2.0+ and Elasticsearch Serverless projects.
